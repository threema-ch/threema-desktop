# Contributing to Threema for Desktop

## Submitting Patches

We accept GitHub pull requests. Please refer to <https://threema.ch/open-source/contributions> for
more information on how to contribute.

Please note that pull requests will not be merged directly on GitHub. Instead, we apply the changes
to our internal repository. Your contributions will then become part of the public repository once
the next release is published.

## Bug Reports / Feature Requests

To report bugs and request new features, please contact the Threema support team through
[threema.ch/support](https://threema.ch/support).

## Translations

We manage our app translations through Crowdin. If you're interested in improving translations, or
if you would like to translate Threema to a new language, please contact us through
[threema.ch/support](https://threema.ch/support).
